# ENIAC-Discount-Analysis

## Overview
This project is a part of the **Data Science Bootcamp** at **WBS Coding School**.  
The analysis was conducted by **Surekha Jan**, **Aleksandra Dominika Gruszka**, and **Pranab Rudra**.  

The primary focus is on understanding how monthly revenue and the average discount rate influence sales performance during the years **2017 to 2018**.  
Additionally, the study explores the relationship between **discounts, seasonal shifts, special events, product categories**, and various **pricing and quantity dynamics**.

---

## Objective
To assess the impact of **Eniac's discounting strategy** on sales performance, categorization, and seasonal variations.  
The analysis aims to provide insights into optimizing discount distribution across product categories and months.

---

## Data Source
The data for this analysis is sourced from **Eniac's discount database**, covering the period from **2017 to 2018**.  
The dataset was cleaned to address issues such as a corrupted database, incongruent data, double-dot numbers, and general data quality concerns.

---

## Tools Used
- **Python (Google Colab)** for data analysis  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Seaborn** for statistical visualization

---

## Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure data integrity:

1. **Corrupted Database:** Identified and addressed issues that affected the overall integrity of the database.  
2. **Incongruent Data:** Resolved inconsistencies, mismatched, and/or duplicate data.  
3. **Double-Dot Numbers:** Rectified anomalies in numerical values, focusing on duplicated or irregular decimal points.  
4. **Data Quality Concerns:** Mitigated issues affecting the reliability and completeness of the dataset.

---

## Analysis and Recommendations
Our analysis indicates that **higher discounts do not necessarily lead to higher revenue**.  
Eniac should therefore avoid blanket high-rate discounting strategies and focus instead on **strategic, time-limited offers**.

### Recommendations
1. Maintain discounts within a reasonable range to preserve margins.  
2. Improve data collection and extend observation periods to capture more seasonal trends.  
3. Ensure standardized product categorization and duplicate checks to refine future analyses.
